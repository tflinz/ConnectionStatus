# ConnectionStatus
## Description
This app is currently a simple notification that sits in the android bar and lets you know if you are connected to wifi, and what the name of the network is.
This kind of visibility is standard on certain builds as part of the OS, but on some (eg. Samsung) it just shows connected to wifi icon and then no way of seeing the SSID without going into the settings screen.
This corrects that. :)
